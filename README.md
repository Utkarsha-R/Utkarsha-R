## Hi there 👋

I'm Utkarsha, a Computer Application student with a knack for data analysis. Over the past year, I've been diving into the world of data, mastering tools like Python, SQL, MS Office, Power BI, and Tableau.

But that's not all! I was also a school representative, which means I've got some solid leadership, communication, and teamwork skills under my belt. I know how to organize and manage projects like a pro.

Since I work with data, I see it everywhere. It's like living in The Matrix, but with more spreadsheets and fewer slow-motion dodges.😂

Feel free to explore my projects and contributions [here](https://github.com/Utkarsha-R/Project-Portfolio) on GitHub. I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and collaborate on cool projects.

You can Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarsha-rohinkar)

Welcome to my GitHub! Let's make some data magic happen! ✨
